# Analyzing_Protein_Sequencing_For_Drug_Discovery
This project is based on computational biology to find drug target proteins by analyzing the protein sequence and some other features.
Step1: Feature Extraction: Finding Average fector distances from 20 amio acids for all sequences(Dataset1)
Step2: Classify GPCR proteins among GPCR,Ion-Channels and Neuclear Receptor Proteins(Dataset1)
Step3: The Proteins which are Classified as GPCR futher investigate whether they are Druggable or Non_Druggable(Dataset2)
Step4: Druggable GPCR Proteins are further classified as Druggable for Heart disease, High Blood Pressure and Schizophrenia (Dataset3)
Step5: Some unknown Protein Sequence (unreviewed in UniProt KB) are tested and labelled following the steps(1-6)
