# Analyzing_Protein_Sequencing_For_Drug_Discovery
This project is based on computational biology( AI application on bioinformatics) to find drug target proteins by analyzing the protein sequence and some other features.

Step1: Feature Extraction: Finding Average vector distances from 20 amino acids for all sequences(Dataset1)

Step2: Classify GPCR proteins among GPCR,Ion-Channels and Nuclear Receptor Proteins(Dataset1)

Step3: The Proteins which are Classified as GPCR further investigate whether they are Druggable or Non_Druggable(Dataset2)

Step4: Druggable GPCR Proteins are further classified as Druggable for Heart disease, High Blood Pressure, and Schizophrenia (Dataset3)

Algorithms Used:
Deep Neural Network,
K-nearest Neighbour,
Decision Tree,
K-means Clustering,
Gaussian Clustering
